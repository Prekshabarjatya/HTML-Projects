      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>200g (about 7 oz) dark chocolate, chopped or chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream (or coconut cream for a lighter touch)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) cold water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Melt the Chocolate & Sugar</strong> – In a heatproof bowl, combine chopped dark chocolate and sugar. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler), stirring occasionally until smooth and melted. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Cream & Flavorings</strong> – Stir in the heavy cream (or coconut cream), vanilla extract, and salt until fully combined and glossy.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk in Cold Water</strong> – Add the cold water to the chocolate mixture and whisk vigorously for about 30 seconds. This helps create that signature light-as-air texture!</li>
    <li><strong>Chill Until Set</strong> – Divide the mousse into serving glasses or one large bowl. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set and slightly firm to the touch.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve & Enjoy!</strong> – Top with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a dusting of cocoa powder. Dive in and enjoy every silky spoonful!</li>
